# Image Processing Web Application using React and Axios

## Activity in Mobile Development 2

This repository contains the source code for an Image Processing Web application developed using React and Axios. It allows users to upload an image, which is then sent to a backend server for prediction. The server returns the prediction result, which is displayed to the user.  The web app communicates with a Flask backend server deployed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict. Flask is a Python micro web framework serving the image processing model and handling prediction requests.Â Ensure that the server is running and accessible from the web app. The Flask server should expose an endpoint /predict for processing image predictions.
